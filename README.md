## About the Archiving Process

Our dedicated team of archivists carefully reviews each submission to ensure it meets our archiving criteria. We use advanced web crawling technology to capture not just the visual elements, but also the interactive features that make WebSim creations unique. Our archive aims to preserve the functionality of these pages as much as possible, allowing future visitors to experience them as they were originally intended.
